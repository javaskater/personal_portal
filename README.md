## Technologies I want to test:

* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the responsive design of my Website...

### Still to implement

* [Latest Angular](https://angular.io/)  for the front end
* [D3 js](https://d3js.org/) for graphic animations
* As the webmaster of:
  * [the Roller Skating Montreuil](http://rsmontreuil.fr/)

  * my interest using that [D3.js library](https://d3js.org/) lies in building tools to extract performance plots from the skaters gears
